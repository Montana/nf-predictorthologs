name: nf-core CI - download refseq (allowed to fail)
# This workflow is triggered on pushes and PRs to the repository.
# This workflow runs a test of downloading the proteome database "other" from
# NCBI RefSeq but this often fails due to connection errors so this test is
# separated out from the rest of ci.yml
